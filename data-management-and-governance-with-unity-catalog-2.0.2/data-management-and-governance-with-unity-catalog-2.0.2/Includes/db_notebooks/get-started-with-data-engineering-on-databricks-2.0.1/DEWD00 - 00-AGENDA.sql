-- MAGIC # Get Started with Data Engineering on Databricks
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC In this course, you will learn basic skills that will allow you to use the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to perform a simple data engineering workflow. You will be given a tour of the workspace, and be shown how to work with objects in Databricks such as catalogs, schemas, volumes, tables, compute clusters, and notebooks. You will follow a basic data engineering workflow to perform tasks such as creating and working with tables, ingesting data into Delta Lake, transforming data through the medallion architecture, and using Databricks Workflows to orchestrate data engineering tasks. With the purchase of a Databricks Labs subscription, the course also closes out with a comprehensive lab exercise to practice what youâ€™ve learned in a live Databricks Workspace environment.
